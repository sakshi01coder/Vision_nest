# The Vision Nest: Design and Visualization Implementation

## Project Overview
The Vision Nest is an interactive web application designed to visualize and customize interior design layouts. It leverages cutting-edge 3D technology to provide users with a dynamic, immersive, and user-friendly experience. By integrating advanced tools and frameworks, the application allows users to experiment with various design elements, creating a highly personalized design environment.

## Features
- **Interactive 3D Visualization:** Real-time 3D rendering of interior spaces using Three.js.
- **Customizable Design Layouts:** Users can experiment with different design elements, such as furniture placement, color schemes, and textures.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** A dynamic and intuitive interface ensures an engaging user experience.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Incorporated user feedback to refine the design and enhance usability, leading to higher satisfaction rates.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **3D Visualization:** Three.js
